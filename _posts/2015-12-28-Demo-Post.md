This is a demo post.

Let's use Rankometer to evaluate this year's candidates, starting with hitters.
Several players (Troy Glaus, Mark Grudzielanek, Mike Lowell, Brad Ausmus,
Mike Sweeney, and David Eckstein) are not shown because they have no seasons in
which they ranked in the top 30 for Wins Above Replacement (WAR) which
Rankometer is based on.
