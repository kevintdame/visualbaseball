Let's use Rankometer to examine a pitcher’s career by visualizing how his WAR stacked up against his peers each season. Since a Hall of Famer should be performing at an elite level, we look at the top 30 starting pitchers in each season, since they would seemingly represent the “elite” (each team’s ace, the top 20 percent, however you want to look at it). Let’s first look at a first ballot Hall of Famer, Greg Maddux. What do my eyes tell me? That this is what a first ballot Hall of Famer!

Now let’s look at Mike Mussina. As before, Rankometer reveals a lesser pitcher than Maddux, but still an elite pitcher for an extended period of time.

Now, let’s look at Andy Pettitte. What do your eyes tell you when you look at his Rankometer? The most die-hard Yankees fan would have difficulty making a case for the Hall of Fame after looking at this Rankometer.
