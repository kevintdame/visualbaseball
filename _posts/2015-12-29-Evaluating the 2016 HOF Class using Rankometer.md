Rankometer is a tool to visually evaluate a player by comparing that player to the elite at his position, in his era, throughout his career. So let's use it to evaluate this year's candidates. Let's start with 2 candidates whose Rankometer shows (undeniably) that they are hall of fame worthy, with long stretches of dominance.  

Barry Bonds:

...and Roger Clemens:

Of course these players are being kept out of the Hall of Fame for PED reasons. Now let's look at some of the other hitters.

Ken Griffey Junior tops the list, with the most impressive Rankometer:

The next tier down is filled with a number of players whose Rankometers look fairly similar. All of these
have the shape of "borderline HOF-er."

Mike Piazza:

Jeff Bagwell:

Jim Edmonds:

Edgar Martinez:

Tim Raines:

Alan Trammel:

It's surprising to me that Piazza and Bagwell get so much more attention than the rest of these players,
given how similar their Rankometers are.
